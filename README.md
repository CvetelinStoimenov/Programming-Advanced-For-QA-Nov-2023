## About the Course
The "Programming Advanced for QA" course delves deeper into programming concepts, covering associative arrays, lambda expressions, LINQ, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming (OOP), including classes and objects, inheritance, and interfaces. Participants will learn to define and use classes and objects and explore advanced topics such as static members, generics, and exception handling. The course concludes with a practical project where students will implement an OOP project, navigate through it, and test it using popular methodologies and best coding practices. Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience through exercises designed to master key concepts.

### Skills You Will Acquire:
- Working with associative data structures
- String text processing and regular expressions
- Handling classes, creating generic classes
